# Timetable grid scanner regression fix

This version corrects the two geometry mistakes that caused the supplied weekly timetable to be merged incorrectly:

- Weekday columns are located from the image's vertical grid rules. The previous midpoint-only approach could start Monday at the left edge of the image and include the time gutter in Monday's column.
- Horizontal separators include both dark cell borders and high-coverage light-gray half-hour gridlines. This keeps entries such as Tuesday's IOT, B. Mallari, and MacLab in separate cells while still allowing large bordered classes to span multiple rows.
- OCR lines whose bounding boxes cross a weekday divider are skipped rather than attached to the neighboring class.
- Room and instructor extraction still runs after lines are grouped by their detected cell, so values such as `Lab2`, `Lab3`, `Room5`, `NetLab`, `MacLab`, and the recognized instructor names remain associated with the class cell.
- The weekly-grid path still avoids falling back to flattened text when it cannot map the grid reliably; it asks for manual review instead of silently guessing.

## Regression geometry checked against the supplied timetable image

The visible weekday dividers are approximately x=192, 303, 416, 525, 642, and 780 pixels. The horizontal grid rules then distinguish, among others:

- Monday RPH / Room 5: 10:30 AM–12:30 PM
- Monday PComm / Room 5 / New GE A: 12:30–1:30 PM
- Monday PE2 / Room 2 / R. Dimatulac: 2:30–4:00 PM
- Tuesday IOT: 2:00–2:30 PM
- Tuesday B. Mallari: 3:00–3:30 PM
- Tuesday QM / Room 5: 12:30–1:30 PM
- Tuesday MacLab: 4:00–4:30 PM
- Wednesday RPH Lab 2 / R. Dimatulac: 10:00–11:00 AM
- Wednesday InfoMan-Lec / NetLab: 11:30 AM–1:30 PM
- Wednesday DS and Algo / Lab 2: 2:00–5:00 PM
- Thursday Mbapp / Lab 3: 2:00–5:00 PM
- Thursday DS and Algo-Lec / Room 2: 5:00–7:00 PM
- Friday PComm / Room 5 / New GE A: 12:30–2:30 PM
- Friday QM / Room 5: 3:00–5:00 PM

The source timetable image's OCR text can vary by device and image quality, so all detected classes should still be reviewed before saving. This environment does not include the Flutter SDK, so a full `flutter analyze` / device build could not be run here.
