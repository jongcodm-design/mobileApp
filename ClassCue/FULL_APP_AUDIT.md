# ClassCue full-app audit against `components-import.html`

Date: 2026-10-20

## Scope and confidence

This audit maps the HTML reference's named sections to the current Flutter source. “Source present” means a matching implementation was found in the code; it does **not** mean the screen has been visually matched or runtime-tested. Flutter/Dart executables were not available in the editing environment, so `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, and a device build could not be run. Screenshot-based comparison also remains outstanding.

Status definitions:
- **Implemented in source** — a clear matching widget/flow exists.
- **Partial / integration gap** — some matching code exists, but the reference's full behavior, shared implementation, or all states are not established.
- **Verification required** — platform, runtime, screenshot, or real-file verification is needed before claiming completion.

## Reference coverage matrix

## Cross-app findings and actions taken in this pass

1. **Integrated the shared `TimeBox` into the real class form.** The form no longer uses a separate private time-field widget. The shared control now supports placeholder and error styling and includes an accessible error-state label.
2. **Integrated the shared `SectionHeader` into Settings group headings.** This reduces one source of visual divergence.
3. **Added a widget test** for the TimeBox error-state semantics.
4. **Unified Settings rows.** The Settings screen now uses `SettingsRow(compact: true)` instead of maintaining a duplicate private row widget. Other local variants should be unified only after confirming their reference appearance and required actions.

## Highest-priority unresolved work

1. Run Flutter format/analyze/test and a debug build with the required Flutter/Dart SDK.
2. Create screenshot comparisons for every major screen and responsive breakpoint.
3. Add end-to-end tests for class CRUD + undo, import review/save/replace, backup/restore, and reminders.
4. Validate OCR with a diverse set of real timetable photos and PDFs with expected output records.
5. Test notification delivery, permission denial, exact alarms, reboot, and schedule changes on real Android devices.
6. Complete accessibility checks for large text, screen readers, keyboard/focus, touch targets, and semantic state.
7. Resolve the remaining private/shared component duplicates after screenshot comparison.

## Reproducible verification commands

Run from `classcue_app/` with Flutter 3.44+ and Dart 3.12+:

```sh
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build apk --debug
```

Then perform manual device checks for file picker, OCR, notification permissions, exact alarms, restore, safe areas, and narrow-width layouts. Until these steps pass, this audit deliberately does not claim the app is complete or pixel-perfect.
